# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Summary
These are various files written in Javascript that displays earthquakes that occured in 2019, along with the labeling of the Tectonic Plates on Earth. We have used Leaflet, an open source Javascript library used for building web-based mapping applications. When loading the webpages, make sure the HTML files for the indicated directories in this repository are executed. This is a representation of the earthquake data in relation to the location of the tectontic plates. This also displays earthquakes that are greater than 4.5 on the Richter Scale. Finally, we included a third map to make the tectonic plates and the earthquake locations more defined.
